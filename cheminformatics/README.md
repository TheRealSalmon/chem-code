**pharm4.py**
<br>
pharm4.py is a pharmacophore visualizer I wrote while I was first learning
RDKit. I was planning to add methods to align pharmacophores but gave up once 
I realized how difficult it would be to do so. I hope to rewrite to the code 
to be better documented, follow modern conventions, and add pharmacophore 
alignment.

**utils.py**
<br>
utils.py contains a hodgepodge of useful Python functions I've written throughout 
my learning.
