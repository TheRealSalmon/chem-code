**pharm4.py**
<br>
There are a couple files in here. For me, my most interesting work is 
pharm4.py. The code is a MESS as I wrote it when I was first learning RDKit. 
However, I think the visualization it produces is still pretty neat. I was 
planning to add methods to align pharmacophores but gave up once I realized 
how difficult it would be to do so. I hope to rewrite to the code to be better 
documented, follow modern conventions, and add pharmacophore alignment. But it 
is overall low priority.
