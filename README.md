# chem-code

Hi, this is where I keep my Python scripts related to cheminformatics and molecular machine learning.

In my **ml-scripts** directory you'll find scripts that evaluate the accuracy of a particular model on ChEMBL data. The typical workflow is illustrated in Jupyter notebooks but is outlined below:
* Load ChEMBL data into a pandas dataframe
* Clean the data and prepare it for featurization
* Split the data 
* Train models with hyperparameter optimization for an evaluation.

In my **cheminf-scripts** directory you'll find scripts, modules, and notebooks related to more traditional cheminformatics topics. 

[Describe some highlights!]
